# Hitman-2-SA-AutoSplitter

Autosplitter for Steam version (1.02), no idea if it'll work for any other version.


# Setting up the autosplitter in Livesplit

● Open Livesplit

● Edit Layout...

● Click the 'Plus' sign -> Control -> Scriptable Auto Splitter

● Double click on Scriptable Auto Splitter and add the downloaded ASL file there

● Also you need splits with every level (except The Graveyard Shift since it doesn't split at the end)

● Also whenever you restart a level it will auto split (i don't know how to fix it) so you're going to need the undo split button
