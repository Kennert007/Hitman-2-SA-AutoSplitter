# Hitman-2-SA-AutoSplitter

● Autosplitter for Steam version (1.02), no idea if it'll work for any other version.

● Since this is my first time programming anything, there are some issues i couldn't figure out, for example:

it will always auto split when restarting a level,

it doesn't auto split when going into The Jacuzzi Job since it doesn't have a proper loading screen when first entering the level.
